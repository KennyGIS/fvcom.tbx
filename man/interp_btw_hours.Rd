\title{Interpolate a WeStCOMS predictions between hours}
\usage{
interp_btw_hours(x, h1, h2, p1, p2)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A number which specifies the fractional hour for which a prediction is desired.}

\item{h1}{An integer which specifies the hour of the first WeStCOMS prediction.}

\item{h2}{An integer which specifies the hour of the surrounding WeStCOMS prediction.}

\item{p1}{A number which specifies the WeStCOMS prediction at \code{h1}.}

\item{p2}{A number which specifies the WeStCOMS prediction at \code{h2}.}
}
\value{
The function returns an interpolated WeStCOMS prediction for a time between two hours at which WeStCOMS predictions are available.
}
\description{
This function linearly interpolates a WeStCOMS prediction between hours.
}
\examples{

#### Example (1): Interpolate environmental conditions between hours
# Imagine we want to know the pedicted temperature at 10:10 am on a given day.
# WeStCOMS outputs the predictions on every hour, so we have predictions for
# ... 10 am and 11 am of 12 and 13 dg C respectively. Then, the interpolated
# ... temperature at 10:10 am is
interp_btw_hours(10+10/60, 10, 11, 12, 13)
