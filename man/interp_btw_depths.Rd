\title{Interpolate a WeStCOMS predictions between depths}
\usage{
interp_btw_depths(x, d1, d2, p1, p2)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A number which specifies the depth for which a prediction is desired.}

\item{d1}{An integer which specifies the depth of the first WeStCOMS prediction.}

\item{d2}{An integer which specifies the depth of the second WeStCOMS prediction.}

\item{p1}{A number which specifies the WeStCOMS prediction at \code{d1}.}

\item{p2}{A number which specifies the WeStCOMS prediction at \code{d2}.}
}
\value{
The function returns an interpolated WeStCOMS prediction for a depth between two depths (the depths of two layers at which WeStCOMS predictions are available).
}
\description{
This function linearly interpolates a WeStCOMS prediction between the depths of two layers.
}
\details{
This function implements linear interpolation between the depths of layers, rather than layer numbers, because the spacing between layers is non linear.
}
\examples{

#### Example (1): Interpolate environmnental conditions between depths
# Imagine we want to know the predicted temperature at depth 25 m on a given day.
# For nodes, WeStCOMS outputs the predictions for each layer. Imagine that the nearest
# ... predictions are for layers 2 and 3 which have depths 20 and 30 m respectively.
# Imagine these predictions are 8 and 9 dg C. Then the interpolated temperature at
# ... depth 25 m is:
interp_btw_depths( 25, 20, 30, 8, 9)
