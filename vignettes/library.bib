  abstract = {Fjordic coastlines provide sheltered locations for finfish and shellfish aquaculture, and are often subject to harmful algal blooms (HABs) some of which develop offshore and are then advected to impact nearshore aquaculture. Numerical models are a potentially important tool for providing early warning of such HAB events. However, the complex topography of fjordic shelf regions is a significant challenge to modelling. This is frequently compounded by complex bathymetry and local weather patterns. Existing structured grid models do not provide the resolution needed to represent these coastlines in their wider shelf context. In a number of locations advectively transported blooms of the ichthyotoxic dinoflagellate Karenia mikimotoi are of particular concern for the finfish industry. Here were present a novel hydrodynamic model of the coastal waters to the west of Scotland that is based on unstructured finite volume methodology, providing a sufficiently high resolution hydrodynamical structure to realistically simulate the transport of particles (such as K. mikimotoi cells) within nearshore waters where aquaculture sites are sited. Model–observation comparisons reveal close correspondence of tidal elevations for major semidiurnal and diurnal tidal constituents. The thermohaline structure of the model and its current fields are also in good agreement with a number of existing observational datasets. Simulations of the transport of Lagrangian drifting buoys, along with the incorporation of an individual-based biological model, based on a bloom of K. mikimotoi, demonstrate that unstructured grid models have considerable potential for HAB prediction in Scotland and in complex topographical regions elsewhere.},

  author = {Braun, Camrin D. and Galuardi, Benjamin and Thorrold, Simon R.}, 
  journal = {Methods in Ecology and Evolution}, 
  abstract = {Electronic tagging of marine fishes is commonly achieved with archival tags that rely on light levels and sea surface temperatures to retrospectively estimate movements. However, methodological issues associated with light‐level geolocation have constrained meaningful inference to species where it is possible to accurately estimate time of sunrise and sunset. Most studies have largely ignored the oceanographic profiles collected by the tag as a potential way to refine light‐level geolocation estimates. Open‐source oceanographic measurements and outputs from high‐resolution models are increasingly available and accessible. Temperature and depth profiles recorded by electronic tags can be integrated with these empirical data and model outputs to construct likelihoods and improve geolocation estimates. The R package HMMoce leverages available tag and oceanographic data to improve position estimates derived from electronic tags using a hidden Markov approach. We illustrate the use of the model and test its performance using example blue and mako shark archival tag data. Model results were validated using independent, known tracks and compared to results from other geolocation approaches. HMMoce exhibited as much as six‐fold improvement in pointwise error as compared to traditional light‐level geolocation approaches. The results demonstrated the general applicability of HMMoce to marine animals, particularly those that do not frequent surface waters during crepuscular periods.},

  title = {{An Unstructured Grid, Finite-Volume, Three-Dimensional, Primitive Equations Ocean Model: Application to Coastal Ocean and Estuaries}}, 
  author = {Chen, Changsheng and Liu, Hedong and Beardsley, Robert C.}, 
  journal = {Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology}, 
  abstract = {An unstructured grid, finite-volume, three-dimensional (3D) primitive equation ocean model has been developed for the study of coastal oceanic and estuarine circulation. The model consists of momentum, continuity, temperature, salinity, and density equations and is closed physically and mathematically using the Mellor and Yamada level-2.5 turbulent closure submodel. The irregular bottom slope is represented using a σ-coordinate transformation, and the horizontal grids comprise unstructured triangular cells. The finite-volume method (FVM) used in this model combines the advantages of a finite-element method (FEM) for geometric flexibility and a finite-difference method (FDM) for simple discrete computation. Currents, temperature, and salinity in the model are computed in the integral form of the equations, which provides a better representation of the conservative laws for mass, momentum, and heat in the coastal region with complex geometry. The model was applied to the Bohai Sea, a semienclosed coastal ocean, and the Satilla River, a Georgia estuary characterized by numerous tidal creeks and inlets. Compared with the results obtained from the finite-difference model (ECOM-si), the new model produces a better simulation of tidal elevations and residual currents, especially around islands and tidal creeks. Given the same initial distribution of temperature in the Bohai Sea, the FVCOM and ECOM-si models show similar distributions of temperature and stratified tidal rectified flow in the interior region away from the coast and islands, but FVCOM appears to provide a better simulation of temperature and currents around the islands, barriers, and inlets with complex topography.},

  abstract = {Acoustic telemetry is a commonly applied method to investigate the ecology of marine animals and provides a scientific basis for management and conservation. Crucial insight in animal behaviour and ecosystem functioning and dynamics is gained through acoustic receiver networks that are established in many different environments around the globe. The main limitation to this technique is the ability of the receivers to detect the signals from tagged animals present in the nearby area. To interpret acoustic data correctly, understanding influencing factors on the detection probability is critical. Therefore, range test studies are an essential part of acoustic telemetry research. Here, we investigated whether specific environmental factors (i.e. wind, currents, waves, background noise, receiver tilt and azimuth) influence the receiver detection probability for a permanent acoustic receiver network in Belgium. Noise and wind speed in relation to distance, the interaction of receiver tilt and azimuth and current speed were the most influential variables affecting the detection probability in this environment. The study indicated that there is high detection probability up to a distance of circa 200 m. A new setup, making use of features that render valuable information for data analysis and interpretation, was tested and revealed general applicability.},

abstract = {Abstract The programming language R is widely used in many fields. We explored the extent of reported R use in the field of ecology using the Web of Science and text mining. We analyzed the frequencies of R packages reported in more than 60,000 peer-reviewed articles published in 30 ecology journals during a 10-yr period ending in 2017. The number of studies reported using R as their primary tool in data analysis increased linearly from 11.4\% in 2008 to 58.0\% in 2017. The top 10 packages reported were lme4, vegan, nlme, ape, MuMIn, MASS, mgcv, ade4, multcomp, and car. The increasing popularity of R has most likely furthered open science in ecological research because it can improve reproducibility of analyses and captures workflows when scripts and codes are included and shared. These findings may not be entirely unique to R because there are other programming languages used by ecologists, but they do strongly suggest that given the relatively high frequency of reported use of R, it is a significant component of contemporary analytics in the field of ecology.},

abstract = {Temperature-depth profiles, including the thermocline, are typically described or characterized by mixed layer depth, thermocline depth, and thermocline strength. Objective methods of estimating these parameters are compared with empirical determinations for 200 CTD profiles collected in the eastern and central tropical Pacific, the subtropical North Pacific, and the California Current. The objective methods are (1) maximum slope by difference, (2) maximum slope by regression, (3) four-segment profile model, (4) inflection point, and (5) variable representative isotherm. Mixed layer depth is well estimated by the temperature criterion of (SST-0.8°C) independent of the estimation of thermocline parameters. Thermocline depth and strength are well estimated by the variable representative isotherm method. However, thermocline strength measured as the slope of the temperature-depth profile does not provide a good measure of stratification of the water column. Therefore, it is recommended that the thermocline strength estimate for a profile be supplemented by an estimate of the standard deviation of temperature in the near-surface layer including the thermocline.},
