# WeStCOMSExploreR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

`WeStCOMSExploreR` is an R package which provides tools for the exploration of unstructured, prism-based hydrodynamic model outputs (i.e. from the Finite Coastal Ocean Volume Model, FVCOM) in `R`. The package has been designed specifically for the West Coast of Scotland Coastal Modelling System (WeStCOMS), which implements FVCOM. Package development has been motivated by the requirements of ecological research, and the need to link hydrodynamic model outputs with ecological analyses implemented in `R`. To this end, the package includes functions which facilitate the following operations: 

* Acquiring WeStCOMS outputs from the Scottish Association of Marine Sciences (SAMS) thredds server;
* Processing WeStCOMS outputs;
* Computing new new fields;
* Building the WeStCOMS unstructured mesh(es) as spatial objects and locating cells and coordinates; 
* Extracting and interpolating model predictions;
* Exploring environmental conditions through space and time with statistical summaries and maps; 
* Validating WeStCOMS predictions with observations, including from diverse animal movement datasets;

## Installation

You can install the released version of WeStCOMSExploreR from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
#### install from CRAN
install.packages("WeStCOMSExploreR")
```

```r
#### Or, install the development version from github
devtools::install_github("edwardlavender/WeStCOMSExploreR")
```

## Acquire files

* `thredds_url()` - list URLs from which to extract or download model outputs on the SAMS thredds server;
* `thredds_extract()` - extract model outputs from the SAMS thredds server;
* `thredds_download()` - download files from the SAMS thredds server;

## Process files  

Hydrodynamic model outputs are typically stored as MATLABÂ® or Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) files. To use these in `R`, some pre-processing outside of `R` may be required. This is described in the vignette. Some functions are designed to facilitate processing WeStCOMS outputs. These include: 

* `date_name()` - flick between dates and WeStCOMS file names;
* `create_wcdirs()` - create folders in which to store WeStCOMS outputs;
* `define_dates2load()` - define a sequence of dates for which to load WeStCOMS files, accounting for corrupt files;
* `WeStCOMSarray2df()` - convert a WeStCOMS array to a dataframe for plotting (see later); 

## Build unstructured mesh(es)

Several functions are designed to facilitate building and working with unstructured meshes. These include: 

* `build_mesh()` - build an unstructured mesh (around nodes or elements) from node coordinates and connections as a `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` in R;
* `find_cells()` - find the mesh cells (for nodes or elements) which enclose inputted coordinates;
* `find_xy()` - find the coordinates of mesh cells (for nodes or elements);

## Compute new fields

Some functions are designed to compute new 2-dimensional fields, either using existing hydrodynamic model outputs (such as current speed) or from scratch (such as sun angle) in cases where it is helpful to express variables which are not resolved by the hydrodynamic model across the same mesh (for instance, to investigate the extent of spatiotemporal variation over the same spatial domain). These include the following: 

* `compute_field_current_direction()` - compute current direction from $u$ and $v$ component vectors; 
* `compute_field_current_speed()` - compute current speed from $u$ and $v$ component vectors;
* `compute_field_wind_direction()` - compute wind direction from $u$ and $v$ component vectors; 
* `compute_field_wind_speed()` - compute wind speed from $u$ and $v$ component vectors; 
* `compute_field_thermocline()` - compute thermoline strength as a new field;
* `compute_field_sun_angle()` - compute sun angle as a new field;
* `compute_field_photoperiod()` - compute photoperiod as a new field;
* `compute_field_depth()` - compute the depths of Sigma layers, extracting parameters from model outputs as necessary;
* `compute_field()` - compute multiple new 2 dimensional hydrodynamic fields (namely, thermocline strength, wind speed, wind direction, current speed, current direction and sun angle) from model outputs at the same time;

## Extract model predictions 

Some functions are designed to faciliate the extraction of model predictions from source files. These include the following: 

* `exclude_corrupt()` and `exclude_unavailable()` exclude corrupt and unavailable files from file names vectors;
* `extract()` - extract WeStCOMS predictions for multiple dates/hours/layers/mesh cells;
* `depth_layer_calc()` - calculate the depth of Sigma layers; 
* `depth_layer_add()` - add the depths of Sigma layers to a dataframe; 
* `depth_layer_assign()` - assign the Sigma layers to a dataframe based on the depth;
* `interp_layer()`, `interp_btw_hours()` and `interp_btw_depths()` - interpolate fractional layer numbers and predictions between hours or layers; 

## Explore environmental conditions

Some functions are designed to facilitate exploration of environmental conditions through space and/or time. These include the following: 

* `summarise2dfield()` - compute statistical summaries of environmental conditions across a WeStCOMS layer (through time for a given WeStCOMS file, if applicable); 
* `plot2dfield()` - visualise environmental conditions across a WeStCOMS layer through space at a specified point in time; 
* `explore()` - implement `summarise2dfield()` and `plot2dfield()` across multiple timepoints and/or WeStCOMS files; 
* `plot3dscape()` and `vis3dscape()` produce interactive, 3-dimensional visualisations of landscapes/seascapes and/or environmental conditions; for large rasters, `crop_aggr_utm()` helps reduce raster dimensions for these functions;

## Validate model predictions 

`validate()` facilitates the comparison of observed conditions (including those from animal movement datasets) with predicted conditions to evaluate WeStCOMS skill. 

## Future functionality 

Future plans for `WeStCOMSExploreR` include developing the following functionality: 

* Exploring temperature profiles through space and time;
* Exploring spatiotemporal variation in environmental conditions in 3d;
* Estimating bottom velocity from vertical profiles;
* Improved flexibility to define new environmental fields;
